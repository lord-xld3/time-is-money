# time-is-money
*What if time = money?*

Let's think about a hypothetical "time currency", in which a person's wealth is correlated to the time they have spent earning that wealth. What problems could it solve, and what problems could it introduce?

This project is firstly an open-source thought experiment, and secondly, given enough time and collaboration, perhaps an open-source collaboration that could change the very foundation of everything.

## What it could solve

These are problems that we can *generally* agree, are problems with typical currencies, like "fiat" or "crypto":

1. **The value of currency is variable due to multiple factors**
  
    - 1.1 This means the security of wealth isn't great. 1 bitcoin could pay your rent this month, but perhaps not the next month.
  
    - 1.2 Even if wealth *were* distributed fairly and equally, existing wealth and distribution of wealth would need to vary at the same rate as the currency to provide consistent security.
    
      - 1.2.1 Assuming 1.2 to be true, "hard currency" could not exist, and constantly changing the value of all existing wealth creates a great deal of overhead.

2. **Distribution of wealth is not equal to the value of work**
    
    - 2.1 Do you believe meaningful work is more rewarding and desirable than the mundane? If given the option, would you choose to: 
      
      - A. work on a robot that identifies and moves packages between locations, or
      
      - B. manually identify and move a package to the correct location, 500 times a day
      
      - ... knowing A. requires continuous learning, having more bad and good days (inconsistent stress), having more ways to fail, would people still choose to do more meaningful work? If we assume people prefer meaningful work, then shouldn't mundane work be valued higher to incentivize someone to do it? Someone still needs to drive the bus, or pickup the garbage, even if nobody wants to do it, because its still critical work until we find a better solution.

    - 2.2 Do you believe 8 hours of farming potatos is more valuable than 8 hours of flipping burgers? Are these the same value? They're certainly both 8 hours away from your loved ones, hobbies, etc.

3. **Money = power**

    - 3.1 Do you believe one person can be "better" than another? Are we all created equally, but different? Are you any better than a murderer just because you don't have the same psychological issues or were raised in a violent environment? 
    
      - To answer this we must also argue - *is "choice" pre-determined? A combination of your unique chemistry and experiences?* Pick a random number right now. Do you believe that's **truly** random? Even if you could think of truly random things, would you randomly choose to murder someone, or is that pre-determined?
    
    - 3.2 Do you believe some opinions carry more "weight" than others? For example, if someone has struggled with drug addiction and rehabilitation therapy, should their opinion carry more "weight" when making decisions about new drug policies?

    - 3.3 Okay so there's some kind of balance between "everyone is equal" and "everyone is different". All voices should be heard, but some should be heard louder than others depending on many factors, like their experience on the subject, work they've done, and even the chemistry that forms their opinion. This could be hard to determine what "weight" each voice should have, and this will be important to figure out.

4. **Greed is natural**

    - 4.1 It is in your best interest to take the option that leads to the highest chance of surviving. When presented without risk, you will always take the better option.

    - 4.2 When weighing risks, there is always a tipping point at which you would take the risk. It will vary for each person, and it may be out of bounds in extreme examples. Suppose a child is starving and will die within a week, should you steal a loaf of bread or let them die?

    - 4.3 In a "for-profit" system, you should maximize and keep the profits, because it gives you a greater chance of success if things go wrong.

    - 4.4 In a "non-profit" system, you should do the minimum work possible, since there are no risks you will take the better option.

5. **Competition vs. Collaboration**

    - 5.1 There must be a balance between competition and collaboration. 
    
    - 5.2 Without competiton, it is more difficult to bring new ideas forward (possible failures, or possible successes). Additionally without competition, referring to 4.4 - "you should do the minimum work possible, since there are no risks you will take the better option".

    - 5.3 Without collaboration, unnecessary work may be done repeatedly (we don't need 10 different kinds of YouTube that all do the same thing)

    - 5.4 The difficult question is, "how do you effectively use competition in a non-profit system, and vice versa? In a for-profit system, you might collaborate only for someone else to take your ideas and do it better, causing you to fail"
