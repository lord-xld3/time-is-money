# time-is-money
*What if time = money?*

Let's think about a hypothetical "time currency", in which a person's wealth is correlated to the time they have spent earning that wealth. What problems could it solve, and what problems could it introduce?

This project is firstly an open-source thought experiment, and secondly, given enough time and collaboration, perhaps an open-source collaboration that could change the very foundation of everything.

## What it could solve

These are problems that we can *generally* agree, are problems with typical currencies, like "fiat" or "crypto":

1. The value of currency is variable due to multiple factors
  
    - 1.1 This means the security of wealth isn't great. 1 bitcoin could pay your rent this month, but perhaps not the next month.
  
    - 1.2 Even if wealth *were* distributed fairly and equally, existing wealth and distribution of wealth would need to vary at the same rate as the currency to provide consistent security.
    
      - 1.2.1 Assuming 1.2 to be true, "hard currency" could not exist, and constantly changing the value of all existing wealth creates a great deal of overhead.

2. Distribution of wealth is not equal to the value of work
    
    - 2.1 Is meaningful work more rewarding and desirable than the mundane? If given the option, would you choose to: 
      
      - A. work on a robot that identifies and moves packages between locations, or
      
      - B. manually identify and move a package to the correct location, 500 times a day
      
    - ... knowing A. requires continuous learning, having more bad and good days (inconsistent stress), having more ways to fail, would people still choose to do more meaningful work? 
    
    - If we assume people prefer meaningful work, then shouldn't mundane work be valued higher to incentivize someone to do it? Someone still needs to drive the bus, or pickup the garbage, even if nobody wants to do it, because its still critical work until we find a better solution.
